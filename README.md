Click [here](https://github.com/FortuneMatthew/Road_Fever/blob/master/github%20markdown%20files/public_site_write-up.md) if you wish to read the plot/story behind this game.

# Project Prerequisites
To get the project files, one needs the following things installed:
* Visual Studio 2013
* Unreal Engine 4.15.0
* Substance Painter for Unreal Engine 4.15.0

# Generating the Project-Files
To generate the project files, one must first have the project cloned to one's desktop. Once one has the project, right click the `Road_Fever.uproject` project file and then click `Generate Visual Studio Project Files`. One must do this every time a class is added or removed from the project [All commits that require a re-generation of the VS project files will have a prefix of RRG (Requires re-generation)].

# Compiling the Project
Once the project files have been generated, open the `Road_Fever.sln` file. This should open in Visual Studio (if it asks what version, it is 2013. Once in the IDE, right click the Road_Fever project within the solution explorer, then set it as the `start-up project`; like so:
